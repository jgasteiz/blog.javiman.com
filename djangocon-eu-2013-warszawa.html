            <div class="entry-content"><p>This is an entry I've been writing during DjangoCon 2013, from several places: hotel bedroom, laying in the grass from DjangoCon, having a beer in some terrace in Warsaw, airplane and back in the office before starting Monday :)</p>
<h2>Friday, 17th May</h2>
<p>Dzień dobry from my hotel room (cloning repos at 30KiB/s). I'm half-exhausted half-excited right now. We are having an awesome weather in Warsaw these days and somehow it charges my batteries. Has to be photosynthesis.</p>
<p>We arrived here  on Tuesday and after a proper afternoon rest, we headed to Stare Miasto to enjoy a bit the city. I managed to take these beautiful pics there.</p>
<p><img alt="Stare Miasto 1" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4gYG4VDaD48/UZKvDAINwhI/AAAAAAAAIYY/rYuEhgPIT9M/w1532-h517-no/PANO_20130514_192834.jpg" title="Stare Miasto" /></p>
<p><img alt="Stare Miasto 2" src="http://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-27IjArG1en4/UZKtfFUSraI/AAAAAAAAIXk/uw2es9HFsc0/w1533-h802-no/PANO_20130514_190623.jpg" title="Stare Miasto" /></p>
<p>On Wednesday morning DjangoCon started. My first impression of the venue was that they had experimented <em>a lot</em> setting up a real circus and trusting a lot on the weather. But after spending a few minutes there I realised they couldn't have chosen a better venue.</p>
<p><img alt="DjangoCon" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PZkNfzT-HH4/UZOwCl0tHGI/AAAAAAAAIcU/bBWh6AloaDk/w1533-h843-no/PANO_20130515_082237.jpg" title="Django Circus" /></p>
<p>YES, it's a real circus. Here's a panorama view from the inside.</p>
<p><img alt="DjangoCon" src="http://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8qbIetxxq_c/UZc01mFeMbI/AAAAAAAAIfg/qEi8PdRIMyc/w1535-h739-no/PANO_20130517_122733.jpg" /></p>
<p>Even thought I missed a few talks during the whole event, I met lots of great, wise and experienced developers/people. </p>
<p><strong>The food</strong>: Since DjangoCon started we've managed to get pierogi, popcorn, sandwiches, beer, <em>scoops</em> of ice cream, fruit, coffee... everything by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bulka.spolka">Bulka i Spólka</a>. For sure, I can tell DjangoCon provided an environment that many other conferences would like to have. <strong>Well done</strong>.</p>
<h2>Saturday, 18th May</h2>
<p>To finish the <em>talkings</em>, <a href="http://sendgrid.com/">SendGrid</a> sponsored Friday's evening party. An awesome performance with the guitar by <a href="https://twitter.com/dN0t">Rob Spectre</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/brandon_rhodes">Brandon Rhodes</a> made the night and eventually we ran out of beer. Sometimes like these, I wish I had a proper camera with me to immortalise these kind of moments.</p>

<p>Oh, and I also got a signed copy of <a href="https://django.2scoops.org/">Two Scoops of Django</a>! - A must read for every Django developer. I don't say this, it's said by many people.</p>
<p><img alt="Two Scoops of Django" src="http://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-yDkh5eUoqgU/UZYMbaIWKXI/AAAAAAAAIfI/jtc5sPCuNHw/w656-h875-no/2013+-+1" /></p>
<p>Hah and if you feel curious about the <em>famous</em> PhotoBooth in DjangoCon, take a look at this <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.578110078887020.1073741829.469934899704539&amp;type=1">public album in facebook</a>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>

<h2>Sunday, 19th May</h2>
<p>The party is over. The sprints are over too. It's been huge, all of it. It's the first time I feel part of a community like this, it feels very nice. I didn't get any picture of the sprints, I was quite immersed in the code for both Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>During Saturday, I <em>tried</em> to contribute to Django project. I worked on a ticket (work still in progress) and from my side it wasn't that much contribution, but after the experience I'm less afraid to pick any ticket now and work on them. It was something necessary in order to start contributing in a future.</p>
<p>I spent today's morning working on personal stuff, something I started coding for personal use (which I'm already using, by the way) and I will release in a near future. But I don't want to talk about it yet. I will only say it has something to do with <em>learning</em> stuff. For now, only languages :p</p>
<h2>Monday, 20th May (already in the office)</h2>
<p>I think the guys in France will have very difficult to organise an event as awesome as this next year, but something else I've learnt these days is: with hard work, motivation and love, you can achieve anything. So as long as next year's organisation works hard on getting an awesome DjangoCon, everything will be just fine.</p>
<p>Dziękuję for these awesome days, DjangoCon + Warsaw!!!</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->
