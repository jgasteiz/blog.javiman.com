<p><strong>Nomadic life</strong></p>
<p>It's been almost six years since I started living away from home and I've had the feeling of not belonging anywhere for all of these years. I've lived in seven or eight different places since then and I spend only a few weeks per year in Vitoria. I guess I don't want to belong anywhere. Someone could tell I am looking for something, moving this much, I don't know. I'll figure it out someday.</p>
<p><strong>Desert</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, it's also related to the desert. The desert rock is the music genre Yawning Man invented back in the eighties-nineties. In terms of <em>desert</em>, it could describe most of the stuff I've had in my mind these last years: how I've behaved and felt with myself and most of the times with other people. The desert could be very warm during the day but it gets really cold at night. That's a close description of how I've been since I moved away from home. And somehow, the desert reminds loneliness too.</p>
<p><strong>Why now?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sp6.fotolog.com/photo/6/12/46/javitheskater/1212073336_f.jpg" title="ah">The first tattoo I've ever thought about</a> was six years ago, during my first months at university. I had the design completely worked out, but I never took a step forward and actually did it. And it's something I regret now. That one meant my adolescence, those amazing years in Vitoria with all my friends, partying and playing music. After moving to London, I knew I was closing another stage in my life and it felt like the right time for doing this.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This picture completely describes the last and closer stage in my life. I couldn't be comfortable with something which will try to describe the present or even the future. This is what it has been, not what it is or it will be.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->

<p>This picture was taken on the 20something of December 2006, during the first (of two haha) After Hours concert. Six years ago and I still have that jumper. I guess my mom is right when she says I must throw lots of clothes away.</p>
<p>So yesterday I ran San Silvestre, some sort of solidarity run which takes place every 31 of December in a lot of cities and towns of Spain. They are usually short enough so many people are able to run it without trouble. It wasn't that easy for me, I guess, as I've only been running for two months. But it was fun. A lot of people were dressed in costumes, some of them running with their dogs, even pushing their children in baby buggies. The end was having fun and raising money.</p>
<p>And today is the most useless day in the whole year. There's nothing you can do, because everything's closed (at least in Spain). And there is also no energy for moving from home to other place. Completely useless. Hm, I believe I still have that picture's jumper somewhere in the junk room...yeah, I can't see a better thing to do today.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"><p>Just moved today into a new flat. This one feels like home, actually. I will (finally) be able to reduce my amount of daily public transport and only take two tubes instead of bus+train+tube every single day. It was exhausting and annoying.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures from my new place.</p>
<p>First one is the living room, from where I'm seated right now. The picture doesn't show the real size of the room, which is quite big. More pictures coming when we get the TV ;)</p>

<p>This one is the kitchen. Small but cozy.</p>

<p>The last one is my bedroom. I guess it's extremely small compared to the other ones. I should have chosen tails :(</p>

<p>I was warned about Truckfighters going out of tune last week in Vitoria, but as far as I know they've done it pretty well today at The Underworld. Except for <em>Atomic</em>, in which guitar, bass and voice were completely out of tune. The voice has been the weakest thing, but making a good balance in general taking into account the brutality of the drums, guitar and bass.</p>
<p>And the mosh pit has been massive. Liters of sweat, people bleeding from their noses and jumping from the stage every ten seconds... absolutely amazing. Can't remember anything similar, even in Berlin Desertfest.</p>
<p>PD: at the end of the concert we were barely able to breathe. Huge lack of oxygen. The Underworld people should fix that.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->
