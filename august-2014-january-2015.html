    <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, I also thought this blog was dead. It's not even I don't have things to tell, I've actually done a lot of them during these last five months, I guess don't really have an excuse for not writing.</p>
<p>Remembering all the stuff will be easier with the help of some pictures, so here it goes.</p>
<h3>September</h3>
<p>The first half of September was so quiet, the second half was a complete madness to compensate. During exactly 2 weeks, I spent the first five days in Poland – my first Polish wedding – and the last ten in the USA, with Potato.</p>
<p>I don't have many pictures from the wedding, so I'll summarise it with these two:</p>
<p><img alt="vodka" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-czXrlpJI7zU/VB_mXNSSPfI/AAAAAAAAQhM/c_2IveantLo/w471-h628-no/IMG_20140920_162732.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>There was half a litre of vodka per human being.</em></p>
<p><img alt="drugs" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cHIDnI1rp3Y/VB_mUDfESpI/AAAAAAAAQhA/8hIQakrSRd8/w837-h628-no/IMG_20140919_214744.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>And because vodka was really good quality, this wasn't really necessary.</em></p>
<p>The Potato offsite, as it could be expected, went over all expectations. This year there was not only one destination, but three: Santa Monica, Las Vegas and Palm Springs, in that order. Notice how the first stop has quite a good balance between party possibilities, beach and relax. Vegas, a big rollercoaster in all imaginable ways. Palm Springs... god, what a nice way of ending this offsite.</p>
<p>Pics!</p>

<p><em>Party Bus - Everytime I get on a bus since this trip, I miss the alcohol and the loud music.</em></p>
<p><img alt="Vegas Baby!" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/i2uBQwZv3V1GwP2jFlac4eNXDU90krZf0Y47hqIWV7IG=w446-h628-no" /></p>
<p><em>...</em></p>
<p><img alt="Palm Springs" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uAO75VUmagY/VCl9lISpceI/AAAAAAAAQ9o/NkI38s0yczI/w1118-h628-no/IMG_20140928_092248964.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>Palm Springs, such a nice desertic views.</em></p>
<p>With a few extra pounds and a horrible jet lag, we get into October.</p>
<h3>October</h3>
<p>Pretty much nothing here. The offsite left my brain half dead for 80% of the month and the only thing I remember from here is the Halloween pumpkins we carved.</p>
<p><img alt="Pumpkins" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Zvj_gnj35Sw/VEvihnJMk3I/AAAAAAAARMw/aB_Gi9R_5B8/w1118-h628-no/IMG_20141025_184839911.jpg" /></p>
<h3>November</h3>
<p>This is the month when I start start feeling interested for reading mostly unconventional books.</p>
<p><img alt="what if?" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8-EcD2qjv80/VFi5GXoWVjI/AAAAAAAARZk/saTQbdkgtLc/w471-h628-no/IMG_20141104_113132.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>Back cover of Randall Munroe's "what if?"</em></p>
<p>And finally someone makes me a visit in London!</p>
<p><img alt="Maikel and JC" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-56eaSBMoaPA/VGDTdkfzLgI/AAAAAAAARko/QPQM1p0cF3w/w837-h628-no/C360_2014-11-10-14-06-15-983.jpg" /></p>
<h3>December</h3>
<p>Mostly, Christmas. It's just everywhere, there's no way of ignoring it. Also, I start getting my hands seriously dirty with Android and Arduino. I publish a couple of (shitty) apps in the Play Store and that makes me spend some extra time learning Android.</p>
<p><img alt="TFL Live Status" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ts6EMFDGUFc/VIjPD82KraI/AAAAAAAASAQ/FKzs_XM_sm8/w353-h628-no/Screenshot_2014-12-10-22-53-52.png" /></p>
<p><em>Pretty shite right now, but this app in particular stays as simple as I need it for my daily usage.</em></p>
<p><img alt="Christmas!" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Us2MbLDHQq0/VJtBHkYLuvI/AAAAAAAASLI/F1ewPEx4UG4/w471-h628-no/IMG_20141224_224005.jpg" /></p>
<h3>January</h3>
<p>Back in Vitoria! For 10 days, time enough for going out every single day and wasting myself after some seriously inactive days in London. There's Jamón and Chorizo everywhere, porky paradise.</p>
<p>And as usual, I get to see all those people I normally don't see in my visits to Vitoria during the rest of the year.</p>
<p><img alt="Friends" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UYYap5uc6ok/VKkWVgECfTI/AAAAAAAASeQ/9cbZ6NFiLjw/w837-h628-no/IMG_20150103_224840.jpg" /></p>
<p>And finally, get back to London to find out my flat electricity is totally screwed. This is the hole they dug in front of my flat.</p>
