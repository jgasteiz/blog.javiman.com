    <div class="entry-content"><p>I read this post a couple of days ago and I have to say I concur in most of the points with the writer. Most of the reasons he talks about are the reasons why I blog. Not to make myself advertisement (at all), or because I have nothing better to do. Actually, most of the last posts I've written are quite short because I have plenty of better things to do. For me is as recreational as reading a good book.</p>
<p>But yeah, as <em>Nathan Marz</em> says,  you should blog because it's good for you. You have very little to loose and a lot to win, such as intelligence! Well, not really, but it does help a lot making you think before talking and in a more organised way, in general.</p>
<p>And for me, that was only when I used to write in spanish. Now I'm even practising english! Very little to loose, indeed.</p>
