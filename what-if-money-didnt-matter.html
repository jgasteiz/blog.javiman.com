<p>If money didn't matter... I would probably do similar stuff to what I do now for a living, but much better. Better, because time wouldn't be an issue, so I could spend as much time as I needed/wanted for learning a particular technology, playing with it, feeling comfortable with it and doing stuff without worrying if someone will pay for it. Thank god I don't worry much about selling what I code, I don't like selling.</p>
<p>Hopefully, if I still have the same hobbies when I get retired (if I ever get retired) and my brain still works, I would love to do stuff just for passion.</p>
<p>But anyway, I'm not complaining at all. I have loads of fun everyday coding at work, <em>playing with LEGO</em>. And these days I've been able to play with <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" title="backbone"><em>new LEGOs</em></a>, so I'm even happier.</p>

<p>Very inspiring video I've seen in <a href="http://blog.floqq.com/empresa/estas-haciendo-lo-que-te-apasiona-en-este-mismo-momento/" title="floqq blog">Floqq's Blog</a> (content in spanish). And I'm posting this as a second part of the post of a couple of days ago, <a href="http://fuzzingtheweb.com/what-if-money-didnt-matter-alan-watts/" title="what if money didn't matter"><em>What if money didn't matter</em></a>.</p>
<p>On that post I told briefly, as usual, what I think I would be doing with my life if money didn't matter. And I said I would probably like to do the same thing I'm doing right now, because I have the luck of enjoying my job. But I also believe that's something that depends on the individual, because I can recognise that coding has never been vocational for me. Actually, I didn't realise how much I enjoyed this whole thing until I was in third year of university, almost finishing my studies.</p>
<p>I would probably have enjoyed this much any other field of human knowledge, because that's how I am. Luckily for me, I think I have the ability of being curious about almost anything. If I had studied psychology (I considered it, actually), I would probably have got really into it. With the proper motivation, of course. And the same would have happened if I had studied physics, which was another option back in time. Anyway, I'm sure I wouldn't be in London right now if I hadn't chosen Computer Engineering in that moment.</p>
<p>I guess I'm the perfect person for choosing wrong in life, because somehow I usually find the bright side of everything. Let's call it optimism/<em>will to power</em>/whatever. What's the point of being unhappy? I mean, why should I be angry about random stuff, while there's probably something out there, reachable for me, that I could be enjoying right now? Isn't it easier and nicer trying to find what makes you happy? I truly think it's way easier.</p>
<p>Ok, enough rambling. What I am trying to say is: do whatever you want to do you with your live. Don't do what your parents want you to do, don't do what anyone expects you to do. Just go somewhere and meditate for a while. It won't be harmful. You might end up doing something crazy, but that's the point. Take risks, don't take them, just do whatever you feel. While being a bit reasonable, if possible. It's always better to regret something you've done than something you haven't.</p>
<p>For example, writing this crappy post. Right now, it feels like a good idea. Tomorrow morning, it will probably not. But what I'm supposed to do, delete it? No way.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->
