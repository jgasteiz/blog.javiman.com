    <div class="entry-content"><p>I'm happy today, more than usual. If someone asks me what I've done for being that happy, I would probably answer <em>work</em>. But it hasn't been <em>regular working</em>, it's been a very comfortable working day. I've been able to answer almost every question I've been asked about the project I'm working on and I'm starting to feel very confident about my tasks.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean I'm not usually confident about what I do (I would say I'm too confident sometimes), but today it's been more than usual. And feeling this way is good for myself, because after this long day I'm not tired at all. Most of the days I arrive home exhausted, with nothing in my mind but a huge need for sleeping, but today it's been like going downhill.</p>
<p>And I'm finally starting to feel comfortable speaking english. These ones have been tough months for me in that way. I'm not used to have a lack of vocabulary when I express myself, so doing it in a language in which I'm no master is hard. That's why I've decided to write more stuff in english in this blog from now on.</p>
<p>I'll sleep well tonight.</p>
