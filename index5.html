                <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of days ago I found in some spanish blog - I can't find the source, sorry - a comparison between how the USA government promotes learning to code and how the spanish government tries (not very hard though) to do the same thing.</p>
<p>Here's the american approach:</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/FC5FbmsH4fw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>They even have a site about it, <a href="http://code.org/">code.org</a></p>
<p>And here's the spanish approach:</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/4tZQtU8QiiY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Pay attention to the code he's working on.</p>

<p>And if anyone is interested, they guy says something like "I'm a programmer" at the beginning and "I studied programming in X place". Not relevant. Or maybe it is, in case you were thinking on studying there.</p>
<p>It feels like they don't want us to learn :(</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"><p>Today will be the last night in my current flat, the place where I've probably spent more time during the last 12 months. Sanctuary for watching films, playing games, lazing, sleeping and, sometimes, working.</p>
<p><img alt="My desk and bookshelf" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2866/11342901484_931b7d029c_z.jpg" /></p>
<p>On Saturday morning I will regret things like having a guitar or heavy books. Every time I've bought something during the last year I've thought for a while on the moving one day I would have to do and how much I would hate myself for that. It didn't make buy less.</p>
<p><img alt="Berlin is a bitch, and then you marry. Nice souvenir I bought in a shop in Kreuzberg" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7364/11342899124_b614ff504d_z.jpg" /></p>
<p>The good thing about this bookself is that it represents most of the things I've done and places I've visited during this year. It's not shown in the picture, but some Russian souvenirs live in the lowest shelf.</p>
<p><img alt="Books I've bought during this year" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7407/11342785855_f7b3f45506_z.jpg" /></p>
<p>Kindles might be a perfect substitute for most of the books in the market, but I still believe there is nothing like paper when we talk about reference or programming books. Flipping pages &gt;&gt;&gt; pressing buttons.</p>
<p>I don't have time for writing more, there are a few bags that need to be filled with stuff. Wish me luck.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->

<p>The film was ok, but</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>did anyone else had the feeling that Steve Jobs (and Jonathan Ive) got extremely caricatured? They looked more like programmed machines to follow one or two behaviours than humans! I still can't understand how Wozniak could put up with him for more than half of the movie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>again, <em>Steve Jobs'</em> way of facing problems seemed so unhuman. It's well known he was a "special" guy for not being the nicest boss / father ever, but I would feel quite offended if anyone pictured me in a film like this. I'd feel offended if he was my family or friend, I think.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have they put all Apple commercials together as a script for Jonathan Ive's role? They made him look like a weirdo. Once more, I'd feel offended if I was him.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from this, the film was fine. Entertaining, although I'd say it's not worthy paying much for watching it :/</p>
<p>I give it two thirds of a star out of two stars. Because weird roles deserve weird ratings.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I've been trying to run <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-glue">grunt-glue</a> in my Elementary OS and after trying to understand why it wasn't running, I realised the JPEG/ZLIB support weren't working.</p>
<p>It usually happens when you install PIL via pip. To fix the issue, do the following:</p>
<p>Uninstall PIL from your virtualenv - please, use <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">virtualenv</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>pip uninstall PIL
</pre></div>


<p>Install PIL dependencies - and python-dev, if you don't have it installed.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>sudo apt-get build-dep python-imaging
sudo apt-get install python-dev
</pre></div>


<p>Create a few symbolic links and install PIL again. When you install PIL, do it with a -U argument to see some output of the installation. I've noticed the sources for 32bit installations would change to <em>i386-linux-gnu</em> instead of <em>x86_64linux-gnu</em>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjpeg.so /usr/lib
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfreetype.so /usr/lib
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so /usr/lib

pip install -U PIL
</pre></div>


<p>If everything went fine, you shoould see something like this if you scroll up a bit:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>PIL 1.1.7 SETUP SUMMARY
version       1.1.7
platform      linux2 2.7.3 (default, Apr 10 2013, 06:20:15)
              [GCC 4.6.3]
*** TKINTER support not available
*** LITTLECMS support not available
</pre></div>


<p>Another option, instead of creating those links manually, would be installing PIL in the machine python installation.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>sudo apt-get install python-imaging
</pre></div>


<p>And another option, although not what you were looking for, would be installing Pillow - which is a better PIL, basically.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>pip install Pillow
</pre></div>


<p>After any of these 3 options you should be able to use the python imaging library happily now.</p>
