    <div class="entry-content"><p>The year is 2044. The Great Recession, the one we have now, is still there and a huge energy crisis has joined it. Real Lifeâ„¢ sucks, but fortunately there is a virtual reality, much better than reality itself, called OASIS. And the access is free.</p>
<p>One day, the creator of this OASIS dies and leaves a last will: he has hidden 3 keys or <em>Easter Eggs</em> in the OASIS and the one who finds the three of them, will inherit all his fortune and the control of the OASIS.</p>
<p>After that happens loads of people, gunters from now on - Egg hunters -, will start looking for the keys. The creator of the OASIS was known to be a fanatic of the 80s pop culture and in order to understand the riddles he left behind and find the keys, every gunter will have to become an expert in the matter.</p>
<p>The book is full of references to videogames, movies, books, comic books, more videogames, tv series and everything you can imagine from the 80s. So everyone who still remembers how the 80s were or even the early 90s, will probably enjoy this book.</p>
