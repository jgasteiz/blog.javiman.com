                <div class="entry-content"><p>I've read <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/01/jobless-europe-young-qualified">this article</a> in my way back home, which was in the home page of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">The Guardian UK</a>. Sad feelings, sad stories. Close and familiar.</p>
<p>I don't have many friends that have left Spain because of the crisis. I'm actually the only one who has done that in my group of friends of Vitoria (my hometown). And the crisis wasn't my main reason for leaving, to be honest, but that's a story for another post. But yeah, I can see many of <em>us</em> walking everyday through the streets of London, talking Spanish to each other, some of them going back home after work, others carrying CVs from one place to another.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I hear a conversation in Spanish in the tube I usually turn off my music and pay attention. Back in Spain, that would be being gossip, but I don't have that feeling here.</p>
<p>The other day for instance, I was listening to a couple of guys talking in the tube. For their accent, I'd say they were from Madrid. One of them was apparently doing quite good. He was happy with his salary and he could even save money, something very uncommon between the spaniard community here, taking into account that most of us work as waiters, kitchen porters and other positions that don't require special qualification. But the other one wasn't that happy. I couldn't get what his job was, but he wasn't happy with it at all. He sounded a bit desperate and nervous. Anyway, I don't want to guess.</p>
<p>Is it always the fault of the politicians? Well, I agree the ones we have in Spain are in their majority shameless idiots. But I think it's most a matter of none knowing how to fix this.</p>
<p>I remember a conversation I had in my last year of high school with a friend. We were rambling about how the future would be, regarding employment (an advanced topic for a high school conversation maybe? :/ ). What both of us were wondering was how different would be the future employment, after so many technological advances. And we knew nothing, back then in 2007, because since then this has gone way further. Basically, the question we were asking ourselves was: <em>Does the world really need so many working people?</em></p>
<p>Back then, both of us thought that if the unemployment was so high is basically because there are no jobs for everyone, plain and simple. Stuff like travel agencies, estate agencies (in Spain, probably the 70% of them are gone), music stores, media stores, cinemas, post offices... all of them seem from a past age. And many more to come.</p>
<p>What we used to say, without giving proper arguments, is that the human race is getting to a point in which we shouldn't work that much. But the established economy model isn't prepared for that yet. I'm sure we'll see some kind of global economy reorganization within ten years. I would like to see it.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->

<p>It's always a pleasure and a bit sad going back to Vitoria for a few days. One part of me, wants to stay there. Another part wants to come back. But I always manage to get moments like these, lucky me!</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"><p>God, it's been a busy June.</p>
<p>A whole week living outside my flat, new and exciting projects which required some <a href="http://angularjs.org/">formation at home</a> and... some <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=real%20world&amp;defid=176772">other things with higher priority than writing here</a>. But here I am again, bringing <strong>great</strong> news from the psychedelic side of life :)</p>
<p>Causa Sui is releasing a new LP this August! I've missed them a lot since their awesome <a href="http://www.causasui.com/releases.html">Pewt'r Sessions</a>, which Vinyl I got last Desertfest (2011), but fortunately here they come again.</p>
<p><img alt="Causa Sui Emporie Tide" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Dbu94Yprgz8/UcIWhpIyBHI/AAAAAAAAJHc/hBmXtUShioU/s500-no/artworks-000045232150-mi0o28-t500x500.jpg" /></p>
<p>And here are the two tracks they've published in their SoundCloud account. Enjoy!</p>
