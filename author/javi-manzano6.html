                <div class="entry-content"><p>As promised, here's a post about this August adventure: a trip going through Russia, Siberia, Mongolia and ending in China.</p>

The adventurers - an adventurer is missing, but this is one of the few pictures in which I'm ok.</p>

We managed to enjoy the night life - once. And we saw the typical russian fight! One guy fighting half naked, almost til death.</p>

Paranoid Matryoshka - in some market, can't remember where.</p>

Unfortunately for us, our girls got bored. Luckily for us, it didn't go any further from there.</p>

Our carriage was the best one. There we are with the staff of the carriage, having beers and cigars, like proper gentlemen.</p>

And before we realise, it's time to come back to London.</p>
<p>It's been awesome, really. A couple of amazing weeks with great people, discovering incredible places. I'd like to do something similar next year.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"><p>I've read <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/01/jobless-europe-young-qualified">this article</a> in my way back home, which was in the home page of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">The Guardian UK</a>. Sad feelings, sad stories. Close and familiar.</p>
<p>I don't have many friends that have left Spain because of the crisis. I'm actually the only one who has done that in my group of friends of Vitoria (my hometown). And the crisis wasn't my main reason for leaving, to be honest, but that's a story for another post. But yeah, I can see many of <em>us</em> walking everyday through the streets of London, talking Spanish to each other, some of them going back home after work, others carrying CVs from one place to another.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I hear a conversation in Spanish in the tube I usually turn off my music and pay attention. Back in Spain, that would be being gossip, but I don't have that feeling here.</p>
<p>The other day for instance, I was listening to a couple of guys talking in the tube. For their accent, I'd say they were from Madrid. One of them was apparently doing quite good. He was happy with his salary and he could even save money, something very uncommon between the spaniard community here, taking into account that most of us work as waiters, kitchen porters and other positions that don't require special qualification. But the other one wasn't that happy. I couldn't get what his job was, but he wasn't happy with it at all. He sounded a bit desperate and nervous. Anyway, I don't want to guess.</p>
<p>Is it always the fault of the politicians? Well, I agree the ones we have in Spain are in their majority shameless idiots. But I think it's most a matter of none knowing how to fix this.</p>
<p>I remember a conversation I had in my last year of high school with a friend. We were rambling about how the future would be, regarding employment (an advanced topic for a high school conversation maybe? :/ ). What both of us were wondering was how different would be the future employment, after so many technological advances. And we knew nothing, back then in 2007, because since then this has gone way further. Basically, the question we were asking ourselves was: <em>Does the world really need so many working people?</em></p>
<p>Back then, both of us thought that if the unemployment was so high is basically because there are no jobs for everyone, plain and simple. Stuff like travel agencies, estate agencies (in Spain, probably the 70% of them are gone), music stores, media stores, cinemas, post offices... all of them seem from a past age. And many more to come.</p>
<p>What we used to say, without giving proper arguments, is that the human race is getting to a point in which we shouldn't work that much. But the established economy model isn't prepared for that yet. I'm sure we'll see some kind of global economy reorganization within ten years. I would like to see it.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->

<p>It's always a pleasure and a bit sad going back to Vitoria for a few days. One part of me, wants to stay there. Another part wants to come back. But I always manage to get moments like these, lucky me!</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"><p>God, it's been a busy June.</p>
<p>A whole week living outside my flat, new and exciting projects which required some <a href="http://angularjs.org/">formation at home</a> and... some <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=real%20world&amp;defid=176772">other things with higher priority than writing here</a>. But here I am again, bringing <strong>great</strong> news from the psychedelic side of life :)</p>
<p>Causa Sui is releasing a new LP this August! I've missed them a lot since their awesome <a href="http://www.causasui.com/releases.html">Pewt'r Sessions</a>, which Vinyl I got last Desertfest (2011), but fortunately here they come again.</p>

<p>And here are the two tracks they've published in their SoundCloud account. Enjoy!</p>

                <div class="entry-content"><p>This is an entry I've been writing during DjangoCon 2013, from several places: hotel bedroom, laying in the grass from DjangoCon, having a beer in some terrace in Warsaw, airplane and back in the office before starting Monday :)</p>
<h2>Friday, 17th May</h2>
<p>Dzień dobry from my hotel room (cloning repos at 30KiB/s). I'm half-exhausted half-excited right now. We are having an awesome weather in Warsaw these days and somehow it charges my batteries. Has to be photosynthesis.</p>
<p>We arrived here  on Tuesday and after a proper afternoon rest, we headed to Stare Miasto to enjoy a bit the city. I managed to take these beautiful pics there.</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning DjangoCon started. My first impression of the venue was that they had experimented <em>a lot</em> setting up a real circus and trusting a lot on the weather. But after spending a few minutes there I realised they couldn't have chosen a better venue.</p>
<p><img alt="DjangoCon" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PZkNfzT-HH4/UZOwCl0tHGI/AAAAAAAAIcU/bBWh6AloaDk/w1533-h843-no/PANO_20130515_082237.jpg" title="Django Circus" /></p>
<p>YES, it's a real circus. Here's a panorama view from the inside.</p>
<p><img alt="DjangoCon" src="http://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8qbIetxxq_c/UZc01mFeMbI/AAAAAAAAIfg/qEi8PdRIMyc/w1535-h739-no/PANO_20130517_122733.jpg" /></p>
<p>Even thought I missed a few talks during the whole event, I met lots of great, wise and experienced developers/people. </p>
<p><strong>The food</strong>: Since DjangoCon started we've managed to get pierogi, popcorn, sandwiches, beer, <em>scoops</em> of ice cream, fruit, coffee... everything by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bulka.spolka">Bulka i Spólka</a>. For sure, I can tell DjangoCon provided an environment that many other conferences would like to have. <strong>Well done</strong>.</p>
<h2>Saturday, 18th May</h2>
<p>To finish the <em>talkings</em>, <a href="http://sendgrid.com/">SendGrid</a> sponsored Friday's evening party. An awesome performance with the guitar by <a href="https://twitter.com/dN0t">Rob Spectre</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/brandon_rhodes">Brandon Rhodes</a> made the night and eventually we ran out of beer. Sometimes like these, I wish I had a proper camera with me to immortalise these kind of moments.</p>

<p>Oh, and I also got a signed copy of <a href="https://django.2scoops.org/">Two Scoops of Django</a>! - A must read for every Django developer. I don't say this, it's said by many people.</p>

<p>Hah and if you feel curious about the <em>famous</em> PhotoBooth in DjangoCon, take a look at this <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.578110078887020.1073741829.469934899704539&amp;type=1">public album in facebook</a>.</p>

<h2>Sunday, 19th May</h2>
<p>The party is over. The sprints are over too. It's been huge, all of it. It's the first time I feel part of a community like this, it feels very nice. I didn't get any picture of the sprints, I was quite immersed in the code for both Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>During Saturday, I <em>tried</em> to contribute to Django project. I worked on a ticket (work still in progress) and from my side it wasn't that much contribution, but after the experience I'm less afraid to pick any ticket now and work on them. It was something necessary in order to start contributing in a future.</p>
<p>I spent today's morning working on personal stuff, something I started coding for personal use (which I'm already using, by the way) and I will release in a near future. But I don't want to talk about it yet. I will only say it has something to do with <em>learning</em> stuff. For now, only languages :p</p>
<h2>Monday, 20th May (already in the office)</h2>
<p>I think the guys in France will have very difficult to organise an event as awesome as this next year, but something else I've learnt these days is: with hard work, motivation and love, you can achieve anything. So as long as next year's organisation works hard on getting an awesome DjangoCon, everything will be just fine.</p>
<p>Dziękuję for these awesome days, DjangoCon + Warsaw!!!</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->
