                <div class="entry-content"><p>I'm back to London after a great (and a bit deserved) holiday around the Basque Country and Spain for ten days. It could have been more, but it's been enough to rest and forget about routine, I think.</p>
<p>The trip begins and ends in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitoria_Gasteiz">Vitoria-Gasteiz</a>, my hometown. We arrive in the middle of <a href="http://englishidiotabroad.blogspot.co.uk/2007/10/spain-11-fiestas-de-la-virgen-blanca-4.html">Fiestas de la Blanca</a>. We were lucky enough to see my friends <a href="http://countach.bandcamp.com/">Countach</a> playing live!</p>
<p><img alt="Countach live" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-lkHRYIokv88/U-QW9qyW3uI/AAAAAAAAP-M/La48nKdeA48/w845-h634-no/IMG_20140807_205257.jpg" /></p>
<p>The next day we need to get up soon because we're <strong>blusas</strong> for a day. I used to do this for the entire festivity years ago, but since I moved to London it's not a easy to do as it used to be - it would require getting 5 days of holiday plus a few extra days only for recorvery.</p>

<p>And <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JaviManzano/posts/Xka8jzx7jBW?pid=6048524182394566594&amp;oid=104971241169939266087">an extra video</a> to show the general mood of that morning.</p>
<p>The weather wasn't the best I've seen there during August, but we managed to stay out of rain for the entire holiday.</p>
<p><img alt="Garaio" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-aFiW9Lb7NaU/U-lHKlR7tzI/AAAAAAAAQGI/v_bb0-lVhSs/w1117-h397-no/IMG_20140811_181657758.jpg" /></p>
<p>After a quick visit to Donostia-San Sebastian, we moved south to Molacillos (Zamora), the village where my father was raised. Chorizo, cheese, red wine and jamón were part of the spanish therapy we got there. Exquisite way of getting rid of stress.</p>
<p>The holiday is getting to an end and we want to say goodbye the proper way, with a massive BBQ with all my friends. We got so much food for lunch, we had dinner with the leftovers. And we still got bread left for today's breakfast.</p>

                <div class="entry-content"><p>I'm back (alive!) from Amsterdam. A few weeks ago, some friends and I decided it could be fun to spend a weekend partying and discovering the city of Amsterdam. And it's been great.</p>
<h3>The canals</h3>
<p>One of the things people are scared about when they go with this kind of purposes to Amsterdam is falling to the canals. I'm not aware if that's something that happens often, but it didn't happen to us. And I have to say they give a beautiful look to the city.</p>
<p><img alt="The canals" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tjGhma4btMU/U6dq0X3duDI/AAAAAAAAPfM/LeszwHXrNAg/w845-h634-no/IMG_20140622_140932.jpg" /></p>
<h3>Bicycles</h3>
<p>I'd be very happy if we had in London half of the cycling paths we saw in Amsterdam. And it would be so cool if didn't live 12 miles away from the office... and if people here wouldn't drive in the wrong side. But that's a different story.</p>
<p><img alt="Bicycles" src="http://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-H5gg4xw_QvQ/U6dqd600GsI/AAAAAAAAPeo/-h1NOoJ8a-Y/w845-h634-no/IMG_20140622_124530.jpg" /></p>
<h3>The weather</h3>
<p>Like Matus said, <em>we don't realise how lucky we've been with the weather</em> – or did we? Luckily enough, I was able to wear shorts every day and get some human being colour in my forehead. Which unfortunately, will run away during the following weeks.</p>
<p><img alt="The weather" src="http://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-4G-XREQfvP8/U6gI3CAqANI/AAAAAAAAPg4/bQ5eCXWvSj4/w845-h634-no/IMG_20140622_195314.jpg" /></p>
<h3>Wildlife</h3>
<p>It must be hard to believe when someone tells you he <em>saw several turtles on a tree, in Amsterdam</em>. Well, here's the proof. In top of this, add swans, ducks, several types of pidgeon-like birds, and maybe, an octopus – that's a joke from the trip.</p>
<p><img alt="Wildlife" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bPw_hCFRess/U6ifDwgk-3I/AAAAAAAAPiM/StcdWdzkGyY/w786-h590-no/IMG_20140622_171055.jpg" /></p>
<p>I'd also mention our hostel, but since it was closer to a prison cell, I'll better skip it.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I'll close the post here before getting into more detail, because I don't even know how legal or politically correct would be to write about it. I'll only say it's been awesome and I'll try to repeat the experience at some point in the future.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m so tired of looking for posts about jumping/deleting words and jumping between the beginning and the end of the line in iTerm2, that I’ve decided to write my own post.</p>
<h3>Word jumping – with option + left/right</h3>
<ul>
<li>Go to iTerm preferences –&gt; “your default profile” –&gt; Keys</li>
<li>get rid of the lines with the two lines sending escape codes with option + left/right</li>
<li>Add a couple of lines in iTerm preferences –&gt; Keys (Global Shortcut keys)<ul>
<li>option + left: Send Escape Sequence, ESC + B</li>
<li>option + right: Send Escape Sequence, ESC + F</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Word deletion – with option + backspace</h3>
<p>Add a line in iTerm preferences –&gt; Keys (Global Shortcut keys):</p>
<ul>
<li>option + backspace: Send Hex Code, 0x1B 0x08</li>
</ul>
<h3>Jump to the beginning/end of a line – with cmd + left/right</h3>
<p>Add a couple of lines in iTerm preferences –&gt; Keys (Global Shortcut keys):</p>
<ul>
<li>cmd + left: Send Hex Code, 0x01</li>
<li>cmd + right: Send Hex Code, 0x05</li>
</ul>
