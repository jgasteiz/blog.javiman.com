                <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, it's not that I don't have any time for writing short updates like this once in a while, it's just I've been a bit busy during the last week: reading, living, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sofing" title="sofing">sofing</a>, surfing the interweb. I've also started working in a different project at work, which has meant more voluntary reading when arriving at home. It might sound hard, but I'm really enjoying it.</p>
<p>Here's something I want to write about: <em>what kind of things do you share online?</em> Yeah, I know it's not a hot topic after months/years of debate around it. But maybe because of that, right now seems the perfect moment for asking yourself what kind of stuff do you share online and with who. I'm not talking about being careful about pedophiles, posting pictures of yourself doing hard drugs or uploading your last amateur porn movie. Let's forget about those topics and think about something much simpler.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we share stuff online</strong></p>
<p>Well, obviously because we think someone cares about it. And I'm sure the 99% of the people doesn't care at all about the 99% of the updates they read in facebook, for example. And I truly believe that around 80% of those people know that fact. Even though, we keep updating. Why? We are fascinating creatures.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of stuff do you share online?</strong></p>
<p>Personal stuff? Professional stuff? Nothing at all? <em>All the things</em>?</p>
<p>People can think I write in this blog because I like writing (I do, by the way. At least I enjoy trying). Or because I want to show the world how cool I am because I have a blog (really, it's so hard having a blog these days! :P). Or maybe because I want to show future employers that I can keep side projects alive. Or maybe because I need psychological assistance and I've realised it's cheaper rambling in a blog than paying a psychologist. Or simply because I want to keep some record of my thoughts, using the blog like some sort of diary.</p>
<p>Those are real questions I've already asked to myself and I've got interesting answers. Which I won't share here, by the way. As a conclusion, I realised I've also changed a lot my way of sharing stuff in the internet during these last years. I guess we all grow up, even in the internet.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Another -and maybe the main- reason why apart from <em>just writing</em> in this blog, I am doing it in english: I need to improve my english. Really, if you want to improve a language (English, Spanish, Python, JavaScript), there is only one way of doing it: practising. Which means speaking/reading/writing.</p>

                <div class="entry-content"><h2>1st part</h2>
<iframe width="100%" height="420" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/IQfa96aP7ow" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>If money didn't matter... I would probably do similar stuff to what I do now for a living, but much better. Better, because time wouldn't be an issue, so I could spend as much time as I needed/wanted for learning a particular technology, playing with it, feeling comfortable with it and doing stuff without worrying if someone will pay for it. Thank god I don't worry much about selling what I code, I don't like selling.</p>
<p>Hopefully, if I still have the same hobbies when I get retired (if I ever get retired) and my brain still works, I would love to do stuff just for passion.</p>
<p>But anyway, I'm not complaining at all. I have loads of fun everyday coding at work, <em>playing with LEGO</em>. And these days I've been able to play with <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" title="backbone"><em>new LEGOs</em></a>, so I'm even happier.</p>
<h2>2nd part</h2>
<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/44124657" width="100%" height="420" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>

<p>Very inspiring video I've seen in <a href="http://blog.floqq.com/empresa/estas-haciendo-lo-que-te-apasiona-en-este-mismo-momento/" title="floqq blog">Floqq's Blog</a> (content in spanish). And I'm posting this as a second part of the post of a couple of days ago, <a href="http://fuzzingtheweb.com/what-if-money-didnt-matter-alan-watts/" title="what if money didn't matter"><em>What if money didn't matter</em></a>.</p>
<p>On that post I told briefly, as usual, what I think I would be doing with my life if money didn't matter. And I said I would probably like to do the same thing I'm doing right now, because I have the luck of enjoying my job. But I also believe that's something that depends on the individual, because I can recognise that coding has never been vocational for me. Actually, I didn't realise how much I enjoyed this whole thing until I was in third year of university, almost finishing my studies.</p>
<p>I would probably have enjoyed this much any other field of human knowledge, because that's how I am. Luckily for me, I think I have the ability of being curious about almost anything. If I had studied psychology (I considered it, actually), I would probably have got really into it. With the proper motivation, of course. And the same would have happened if I had studied physics, which was another option back in time. Anyway, I'm sure I wouldn't be in London right now if I hadn't chosen Computer Engineering in that moment.</p>
<p>I guess I'm the perfect person for choosing wrong in life, because somehow I usually find the bright side of everything. Let's call it optimism/<em>will to power</em>/whatever. What's the point of being unhappy? I mean, why should I be angry about random stuff, while there's probably something out there, reachable for me, that I could be enjoying right now? Isn't it easier and nicer trying to find what makes you happy? I truly think it's way easier.</p>
<p>Ok, enough rambling. What I am trying to say is: do whatever you want to do you with your live. Don't do what your parents want you to do, don't do what anyone expects you to do. Just go somewhere and meditate for a while. It won't be harmful. You might end up doing something crazy, but that's the point. Take risks, don't take them, just do whatever you feel. While being a bit reasonable, if possible. It's always better to regret something you've done than something you haven't.</p>
<p>For example, writing this crappy post. Right now, it feels like a good idea. Tomorrow morning, it will probably not. But what I'm supposed to do, delete it? No way.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->

<p>A 5-year part of my life has come to an end after signing this last documents. It's been nice, I won't say the opposite, but I'm also happy it came to an end. I have plenty of new and exciting stuff to experience now :)</p>
