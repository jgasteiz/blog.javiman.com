<p>Say what you need to say<br />
Make it clear<br />
Make it great<br />
Cause it’s not too late<br />
And there’s no mistake<br />
When you shine<br />
Shake it for me anyway<br />
Now we crash the gate<br />
To investigate<br />
Your fate</p>
<p>Pleasure to meet you<br />
Got so much more<br />
To offer the world<br />
See what’s in store<br />
Stay all day<br />
Someone to love<br />
That’s my boy chip chop<br />
Open the doors<br />
And we never close shop<br />
Stay all day</p>
<p>Take what you need to take<br />
To forsake<br />
Make it for me anyway<br />
When we fill the void<br />
That is <strong style="color: #DD24BF;">Pink As Floyd</strong><br />
To destroy<br />
Records that we file away<br />
And I’ll clean the slate<br />
As I calculate<br />
Your fate</p>
<p>Pleasure to meet you<br />
Got so much more<br />
To offer the world<br />
See what’s in store<br />
Stay all day<br />
Someone to love<br />
That’s my boy chip chop<br />
Open the doors<br />
And we never close shop<br />
Stay all day</p>
<p>And you shine as you redefine<br />
Your time, just another time of day<br />
Do you feel the spark<br />
When you play the part<br />
Superstar<br />
Fake it for me anyway<br />
Time to tell them all<br />
Without hem or haw<br />
No applause<br />
Tell them how to generate<br />
How to raise the bar<br />
How to keep it hard<br />
To be alive, make it for me anyway<br />
If you care at all<br />
You will bare it all<br />
You will grind, shake it for me anyway<br />
Born to play the part<br />
Dying for your art<br />
Cuz it’s time<br />
Take it for me anyway<br />
You will clear the air<br />
With a single stare<br />
Your fate</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->

<p>This picture is part of Yawning Man's last album cover, <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-x3gv-U9deWI/Tj8d8wR8VOI/AAAAAAAABFk/xihwaQHkCdI/s1600/Yawning%2BMan%2B-%2B2010%2B-%2BNomadic%2BPursuits.jpg" title="nomadic pursuits">Nomadic Pursuits</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Nomadic life</strong></p>
<p>It's been almost six years since I started living away from home and I've had the feeling of not belonging anywhere for all of these years. I've lived in seven or eight different places since then and I spend only a few weeks per year in Vitoria. I guess I don't want to belong anywhere. Someone could tell I am looking for something, moving this much, I don't know. I'll figure it out someday.</p>
<p><strong>Desert</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, it's also related to the desert. The desert rock is the music genre Yawning Man invented back in the eighties-nineties. In terms of <em>desert</em>, it could describe most of the stuff I've had in my mind these last years: how I've behaved and felt with myself and most of the times with other people. The desert could be very warm during the day but it gets really cold at night. That's a close description of how I've been since I moved away from home. And somehow, the desert reminds loneliness too.</p>
<p><strong>Why now?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://sp6.fotolog.com/photo/6/12/46/javitheskater/1212073336_f.jpg" title="ah">The first tattoo I've ever thought about</a> was six years ago, during my first months at university. I had the design completely worked out, but I never took a step forward and actually did it. And it's something I regret now. That one meant my adolescence, those amazing years in Vitoria with all my friends, partying and playing music. After moving to London, I knew I was closing another stage in my life and it felt like the right time for doing this.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This picture completely describes the last and closer stage in my life. I couldn't be comfortable with something which will try to describe the present or even the future. This is what it has been, not what it is or it will be.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->

<p>This picture was taken on the 20something of December 2006, during the first (of two haha) After Hours concert. Six years ago and I still have that jumper. I guess my mom is right when she says I must throw lots of clothes away.</p>
<p>So yesterday I ran San Silvestre, some sort of solidarity run which takes place every 31 of December in a lot of cities and towns of Spain. They are usually short enough so many people are able to run it without trouble. It wasn't that easy for me, I guess, as I've only been running for two months. But it was fun. A lot of people were dressed in costumes, some of them running with their dogs, even pushing their children in baby buggies. The end was having fun and raising money.</p>
<p>And today is the most useless day in the whole year. There's nothing you can do, because everything's closed (at least in Spain). And there is also no energy for moving from home to other place. Completely useless. Hm, I believe I still have that picture's jumper somewhere in the junk room...yeah, I can't see a better thing to do today.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->
