                <div class="entry-content"><p>The year is 2044. The Great Recession, the one we have now, is still there and a huge energy crisis has joined it. Real Lifeâ„¢ sucks, but fortunately there is a virtual reality, much better than reality itself, called OASIS. And the access is free.</p>
<p>One day, the creator of this OASIS dies and leaves a last will: he has hidden 3 keys or <em>Easter Eggs</em> in the OASIS and the one who finds the three of them, will inherit all his fortune and the control of the OASIS.</p>
<p>After that happens loads of people, gunters from now on - Egg hunters -, will start looking for the keys. The creator of the OASIS was known to be a fanatic of the 80s pop culture and in order to understand the riddles he left behind and find the keys, every gunter will have to become an expert in the matter.</p>
<p>The book is full of references to videogames, movies, books, comic books, more videogames, tv series and everything you can imagine from the 80s. So everyone who still remembers how the 80s were or even the early 90s, will probably enjoy this book.</p>

                <div class="entry-content"><p>I'm back here since this Monday morning, that's one of the few and vague reasons I haven't written in a few days. That and Christmas excitement. New year's eve has been brutal this year. I can't remember a night as epic as this year's has been, hard to believe. Specially because I don't usually enjoy new year's eve at all.</p>
<p>I brought the new camera to Spain and I've some time to spend learning the basics about it. After reading some book introductions and blog posts, I've got a common message from all of them: I should try to make tons of pictures. Apparently "learning by doing" is the best way of learning. Good stuff. I've also started uploading some of them to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jgasteiz/">my flickr account</a>.</p>
<p><em>A couple of seconds of shutter speed in the darkness of my bedroom made the trick.</em></p>
<p><img alt="vinyl" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3822/11719225215_4f406bfc08_z.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>After reading one of the first chapters of <a href="http://www.ppsop.com/unex.aspx">Understanding Exposure, by Bryan Peterson</a>, I had the feeling of trying something the book explained about playing with values for getting cool exposures. For getting this, I've also changed some stuff in Lightroom.</em></p>
<p><img alt="from my window" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5516/11778545294_2c581dece4_z.jpg" /></p>
<p>A tripod was used for both pictures, I got a cheap one the other day - I know, I know, none recommends cheap tripods. But I'm definitely not spending a lot on a tripod now, and 12 euros seemed quite reasonable for what I got. Better that than nothing, right?</p>
<p>And that's all folks.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"><p>Funny moment when you are watching a science fiction movie and you realise a guy - William Fichtner - who is doing some work on his computer is actually programming assembler. Nice one, but taking into account the story is set in 2154, it seems a bit too much.</p>

<p>I just can't help stopping a movie I'm watching everytime I see a scene in which someone is typing something. I'm always looking forward to finding stuff like this.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of days ago I found in some spanish blog - I can't find the source, sorry - a comparison between how the USA government promotes learning to code and how the spanish government tries (not very hard though) to do the same thing.</p>
<p>Here's the american approach:</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/FC5FbmsH4fw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>They even have a site about it, <a href="http://code.org/">code.org</a></p>
<p>And here's the spanish approach:</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/4tZQtU8QiiY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Pay attention to the code he's working on.</p>
<p><img alt="Some piece of shit" src="http://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-f_CzM1J-0c4/UqsPZ9rd0bI/AAAAAAAANOw/uk9NDR-8CoA/w641-h390-no/Screen+Shot+2013-12-13+at+13.44.13.png" /></p>
<p>And if anyone is interested, they guy says something like "I'm a programmer" at the beginning and "I studied programming in X place". Not relevant. Or maybe it is, in case you were thinking on studying there.</p>
<p>It feels like they don't want us to learn :(</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->
