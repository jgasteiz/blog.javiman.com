                <div class="entry-content"><p>I read this post a couple of days ago and I have to say I concur in most of the points with the writer. Most of the reasons he talks about are the reasons why I blog. Not to make myself advertisement (at all), or because I have nothing better to do. Actually, most of the last posts I've written are quite short because I have plenty of better things to do. For me is as recreational as reading a good book.</p>
<p>But yeah, as <em>Nathan Marz</em> says,  you should blog because it's good for you. You have very little to loose and a lot to win, such as intelligence! Well, not really, but it does help a lot making you think before talking and in a more organised way, in general.</p>
<p>And for me, that was only when I used to write in spanish. Now I'm even practising english! Very little to loose, indeed.</p>

<p>And I also haven't touch a keyboard during the weekend, which is cool. It's been some kind of disconnection weekend, something I'm enjoying quite a lot lately. Anyway, I will probably compensate touching too much keyboard during this whole week, as usual.</p>

                <div class="entry-content"><p>Plugging in the external hard drive to the laptop is kind of the same thing as start looking for old stuff in your parents' house junk room.</p>
<p><img alt="after hours" src="http://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-KrbuALigixw/UOLNXhqR3fI/AAAAAAAADzI/JPhpBdKkSa8/s500/1265098685666_f.jpg" title="after hours" /></p>
<p>This picture was taken on the 20something of December 2006, during the first (of two haha) After Hours concert. Six years ago and I still have that jumper. I guess my mom is right when she says I must throw lots of clothes away.</p>
<p>So yesterday I ran San Silvestre, some sort of solidarity run which takes place every 31 of December in a lot of cities and towns of Spain. They are usually short enough so many people are able to run it without trouble. It wasn't that easy for me, I guess, as I've only been running for two months. But it was fun. A lot of people were dressed in costumes, some of them running with their dogs, even pushing their children in baby buggies. The end was having fun and raising money.</p>
<p>And today is the most useless day in the whole year. There's nothing you can do, because everything's closed (at least in Spain). And there is also no energy for moving from home to other place. Completely useless. Hm, I believe I still have that picture's jumper somewhere in the junk room...yeah, I can't see a better thing to do today.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->
