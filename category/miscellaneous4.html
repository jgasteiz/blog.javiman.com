                <div class="entry-content"><p>I'm back here since this Monday morning, that's one of the few and vague reasons I haven't written in a few days. That and Christmas excitement. New year's eve has been brutal this year. I can't remember a night as epic as this year's has been, hard to believe. Specially because I don't usually enjoy new year's eve at all.</p>
<p>I brought the new camera to Spain and I've some time to spend learning the basics about it. After reading some book introductions and blog posts, I've got a common message from all of them: I should try to make tons of pictures. Apparently "learning by doing" is the best way of learning. Good stuff. I've also started uploading some of them to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jgasteiz/">my flickr account</a>.</p>
<p><em>A couple of seconds of shutter speed in the darkness of my bedroom made the trick.</em></p>
<p><img alt="vinyl" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3822/11719225215_4f406bfc08_z.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>After reading one of the first chapters of <a href="http://www.ppsop.com/unex.aspx">Understanding Exposure, by Bryan Peterson</a>, I had the feeling of trying something the book explained about playing with values for getting cool exposures. For getting this, I've also changed some stuff in Lightroom.</em></p>
<p><img alt="from my window" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5516/11778545294_2c581dece4_z.jpg" /></p>
<p>A tripod was used for both pictures, I got a cheap one the other day - I know, I know, none recommends cheap tripods. But I'm definitely not spending a lot on a tripod now, and 12 euros seemed quite reasonable for what I got. Better that than nothing, right?</p>
<p>And that's all folks.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"><p>Today will be the last night in my current flat, the place where I've probably spent more time during the last 12 months. Sanctuary for watching films, playing games, lazing, sleeping and, sometimes, working.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning I will regret things like having a guitar or heavy books. Every time I've bought something during the last year I've thought for a while on the moving one day I would have to do and how much I would hate myself for that. It didn't make buy less.</p>
<p><img alt="Berlin is a bitch, and then you marry. Nice souvenir I bought in a shop in Kreuzberg" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7364/11342899124_b614ff504d_z.jpg" /></p>
<p>The good thing about this bookself is that it represents most of the things I've done and places I've visited during this year. It's not shown in the picture, but some Russian souvenirs live in the lowest shelf.</p>
<p><img alt="Books I've bought during this year" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7407/11342785855_f7b3f45506_z.jpg" /></p>
<p>Kindles might be a perfect substitute for most of the books in the market, but I still believe there is nothing like paper when we talk about reference or programming books. Flipping pages &gt;&gt;&gt; pressing buttons.</p>
<p>I don't have time for writing more, there are a few bags that need to be filled with stuff. Wish me luck.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->

<p>The film was ok, but</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>did anyone else had the feeling that Steve Jobs (and Jonathan Ive) got extremely caricatured? They looked more like programmed machines to follow one or two behaviours than humans! I still can't understand how Wozniak could put up with him for more than half of the movie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>again, <em>Steve Jobs'</em> way of facing problems seemed so unhuman. It's well known he was a "special" guy for not being the nicest boss / father ever, but I would feel quite offended if anyone pictured me in a film like this. I'd feel offended if he was my family or friend, I think.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have they put all Apple commercials together as a script for Jonathan Ive's role? They made him look like a weirdo. Once more, I'd feel offended if I was him.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from this, the film was fine. Entertaining, although I'd say it's not worthy paying much for watching it :/</p>
<p>I give it two thirds of a star out of two stars. Because weird roles deserve weird ratings.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->
