                <div class="entry-content"><p>I've recently moved to a new flat. The fact that I love most about it is that I don't have neighbours. Well, almost.</p>
<p>The flat is the top floor of a big house, which ground and first floors are used by a charity. So we technically have neighbours from Monday to Friday, 9 to 5.</p>
<p>One of the requirements for living in my current flat was having a clean criminal history, at least clean in all matters related with children - the charity is for children with disabilities. To check our criminal records we had to go through a short interview with one of the charity workers and fill in some forms. Not a big deal.</p>
<p>One of the questions you get to answer in this interview is "what do you do for a living". When I told the guy I was a web developer, he raised his eyebrows and said something like "oh, that's cool! We could actually use some help with our website here, we're having some trouble getting some stuff working properly". I told him I'd be happy to help. It's always good to have a nice relationship with your neighbours.</p>
<p>The weeks went by and we moved in. Of course, we didn't have internet in place, so I thought I could ask them for <em>some</em> and offer my help with their website, regardless they could give me access to their internet or not. I wrote a friendly email asking for internet to the guy I met during my interview and he raised the query to his supervisor. Then I realised that this charity probably worked as any other company out there and they probably couldn't just share their internet that easily. Pretty understandable, that's how things work.</p>
<p>I was right about that, they couldn't give me internet because they manage private and important data, <em>bla bla bla</em> - I was expecting it. But, here comes the irony, they also can't accept my help for the same reason. Doesn't it sound stupid? I'd like to help a charity doing one of the few things I know how to do right and they just can't accept my help.</p>
<p>But who can blame them, they are only following rules there. They seem nice people and because we'll be in the building at different times during the day, I'm sure we'll get to be good neighbours.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->
