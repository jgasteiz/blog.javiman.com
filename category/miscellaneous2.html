Great dinner full of meat in Putney's <a href="http://rodiziopreto.co.uk/">Rodizio Preto</a> followed by a massive ale ingest in the closest wetherspoons and finished by more beer in a local club. Nothing fancy, that's why it ruled.</p>
<p>And I got amazing presents! This beer crafting kit between them :)</p>

                <div class="entry-content"><p>I'm back here since this Monday morning, that's one of the few and vague reasons I haven't written in a few days. That and Christmas excitement. New year's eve has been brutal this year. I can't remember a night as epic as this year's has been, hard to believe. Specially because I don't usually enjoy new year's eve at all.</p>
<p>I brought the new camera to Spain and I've some time to spend learning the basics about it. After reading some book introductions and blog posts, I've got a common message from all of them: I should try to make tons of pictures. Apparently "learning by doing" is the best way of learning. Good stuff. I've also started uploading some of them to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jgasteiz/">my flickr account</a>.</p>
<p><em>A couple of seconds of shutter speed in the darkness of my bedroom made the trick.</em></p>

<p><em>After reading one of the first chapters of <a href="http://www.ppsop.com/unex.aspx">Understanding Exposure, by Bryan Peterson</a>, I had the feeling of trying something the book explained about playing with values for getting cool exposures. For getting this, I've also changed some stuff in Lightroom.</em></p>
<p><img alt="from my window" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5516/11778545294_2c581dece4_z.jpg" /></p>
<p>A tripod was used for both pictures, I got a cheap one the other day - I know, I know, none recommends cheap tripods. But I'm definitely not spending a lot on a tripod now, and 12 euros seemed quite reasonable for what I got. Better that than nothing, right?</p>
<p>And that's all folks.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"><p>Today will be the last night in my current flat, the place where I've probably spent more time during the last 12 months. Sanctuary for watching films, playing games, lazing, sleeping and, sometimes, working.</p>
<p><img alt="My desk and bookshelf" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2866/11342901484_931b7d029c_z.jpg" /></p>
<p>On Saturday morning I will regret things like having a guitar or heavy books. Every time I've bought something during the last year I've thought for a while on the moving one day I would have to do and how much I would hate myself for that. It didn't make buy less.</p>
<p><img alt="Berlin is a bitch, and then you marry. Nice souvenir I bought in a shop in Kreuzberg" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7364/11342899124_b614ff504d_z.jpg" /></p>
<p>The good thing about this bookself is that it represents most of the things I've done and places I've visited during this year. It's not shown in the picture, but some Russian souvenirs live in the lowest shelf.</p>
<p><img alt="Books I've bought during this year" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7407/11342785855_f7b3f45506_z.jpg" /></p>
<p>Kindles might be a perfect substitute for most of the books in the market, but I still believe there is nothing like paper when we talk about reference or programming books. Flipping pages &gt;&gt;&gt; pressing buttons.</p>
<p>I don't have time for writing more, there are a few bags that need to be filled with stuff. Wish me luck.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->
