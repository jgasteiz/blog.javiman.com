                <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow, I can't remember the last time it was so long without writing a post. I've actually done a lot of things during these last five months, I don't really have any excuse for not writing.</p>
<p>Remembering all the stuff will be easier with the help of some pictures, so here they go.</p>
<h3>September</h3>
<p>The first half of September was so quiet, the second half had to be complete madness to compensate. During exactly 2 weeks, I spent the first five in Poland – Polish wedding! – and the last ten in the USA, with Potato.</p>
<p>I don't have many pictures from the wedding, so I'll summarise it with these two:</p>
<p><img alt="vodka" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-czXrlpJI7zU/VB_mXNSSPfI/AAAAAAAAQhM/c_2IveantLo/w471-h628-no/IMG_20140920_162732.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>There was half a litre of vodka per human being.</em></p>
<p><img alt="drugs" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cHIDnI1rp3Y/VB_mUDfESpI/AAAAAAAAQhA/8hIQakrSRd8/w837-h628-no/IMG_20140919_214744.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>And because vodka was really good quality, this wasn't really necessary.</em></p>
<p>The Potato offsite, as it could be expected, went over all expectations. This year there was not only one destination, but three: Santa Monica, Las Vegas and Palm Springs, in that order. Notice how the first stop has quite a good balance between party possibilities, beach and relax. Vegas, a big rollercoaster in all imaginable ways. Palm Springs... god, what a nice way of ending this offsite.</p>

<p><em>Palm Springs, such a nice desertic views.</em></p>
<p>With a few extra pounds and a horrible jet lag, we get into October.</p>
<h3>October</h3>
<p>Pretty much nothing here. The offsite left my brain half dead for 80% of the month and the only thing I remember from here is the Halloween pumpkins we carved.</p>
<p><img alt="Pumpkins" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Zvj_gnj35Sw/VEvihnJMk3I/AAAAAAAARMw/aB_Gi9R_5B8/w1118-h628-no/IMG_20141025_184839911.jpg" /></p>
<h3>November</h3>
<p>This is the month when I start start feeling interested for reading mostly unconventional books.</p>
<p><img alt="what if?" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8-EcD2qjv80/VFi5GXoWVjI/AAAAAAAARZk/saTQbdkgtLc/w471-h628-no/IMG_20141104_113132.jpg" /></p>

<p>And finally someone makes me a visit in London!</p>

<h3>December</h3>
<p>Mostly, Christmas. It's just everywhere, there's no way of ignoring it. Also, I start getting my hands seriously dirty with Android and Arduino. I publish a couple of (shitty) apps in the Play Store and that makes me spend some extra time learning Android.</p>
<p><img alt="TFL Live Status" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ts6EMFDGUFc/VIjPD82KraI/AAAAAAAASAQ/FKzs_XM_sm8/w353-h628-no/Screenshot_2014-12-10-22-53-52.png" /></p>
<p><em>Pretty shite right now, but this app in particular stays as simple as I need it for my daily usage.</em></p>

<h3>January</h3>
<p>Back in Vitoria! For 10 days, time enough for going out every single day and wasting myself after some seriously inactive days in London. There's Jamón and Chorizo everywhere, porky paradise.</p>
<p>And as usual, I get to see all those people I normally don't see in my visits to Vitoria during the rest of the year.</p>
<p><img alt="Friends" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UYYap5uc6ok/VKkWVgECfTI/AAAAAAAASeQ/9cbZ6NFiLjw/w837-h628-no/IMG_20150103_224840.jpg" /></p>
<p>And finally, get back to London to find out my flat electricity is totally screwed. This is the hole they dug in front of my flat.</p>

                <div class="entry-content"><p>I've recently moved to a new flat. The fact that I love most about it is that I don't have neighbours. Well, almost.</p>
<p>The flat is the top floor of a big house, which ground and first floors are used by a charity. So we technically have neighbours from Monday to Friday, 9 to 5.</p>
<p>One of the requirements for living in my current flat was having a clean criminal history, at least clean in all matters related with children - the charity is for children with disabilities. To check our criminal records we had to go through a short interview with one of the charity workers and fill in some forms. Not a big deal.</p>
<p>One of the questions you get to answer in this interview is "what do you do for a living". When I told the guy I was a web developer, he raised his eyebrows and said something like "oh, that's cool! We could actually use some help with our website here, we're having some trouble getting some stuff working properly". I told him I'd be happy to help. It's always good to have a nice relationship with your neighbours.</p>
<p>The weeks went by and we moved in. Of course, we didn't have internet in place, so I thought I could ask them for <em>some</em> and offer my help with their website, regardless they could give me access to their internet or not. I wrote a friendly email asking for internet to the guy I met during my interview and he raised the query to his supervisor. Then I realised that this charity probably worked as any other company out there and they probably couldn't just share their internet that easily. Pretty understandable, that's how things work.</p>
<p>I was right about that, they couldn't give me internet because they manage private and important data, <em>bla bla bla</em> - I was expecting it. But, here comes the irony, they also can't accept my help for the same reason. Doesn't it sound stupid? I'd like to help a charity doing one of the few things I know how to do right and they just can't accept my help.</p>
<p>But who can blame them, they are only following rules there. They seem nice people and because we'll be in the building at different times during the day, I'm sure we'll get to be good neighbours.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->
