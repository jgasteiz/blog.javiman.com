                <div class="entry-content"><p>I've read <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/01/jobless-europe-young-qualified">this article</a> in my way back home, which was in the home page of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">The Guardian UK</a>. Sad feelings, sad stories. Close and familiar.</p>
<p>I don't have many friends that have left Spain because of the crisis. I'm actually the only one who has done that in my group of friends of Vitoria (my hometown). And the crisis wasn't my main reason for leaving, to be honest, but that's a story for another post. But yeah, I can see many of <em>us</em> walking everyday through the streets of London, talking Spanish to each other, some of them going back home after work, others carrying CVs from one place to another.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I hear a conversation in Spanish in the tube I usually turn off my music and pay attention. Back in Spain, that would be being gossip, but I don't have that feeling here.</p>
<p>The other day for instance, I was listening to a couple of guys talking in the tube. For their accent, I'd say they were from Madrid. One of them was apparently doing quite good. He was happy with his salary and he could even save money, something very uncommon between the spaniard community here, taking into account that most of us work as waiters, kitchen porters and other positions that don't require special qualification. But the other one wasn't that happy. I couldn't get what his job was, but he wasn't happy with it at all. He sounded a bit desperate and nervous. Anyway, I don't want to guess.</p>
<p>Is it always the fault of the politicians? Well, I agree the ones we have in Spain are in their majority shameless idiots. But I think it's most a matter of none knowing how to fix this.</p>
<p>I remember a conversation I had in my last year of high school with a friend. We were rambling about how the future would be, regarding employment (an advanced topic for a high school conversation maybe? :/ ). What both of us were wondering was how different would be the future employment, after so many technological advances. And we knew nothing, back then in 2007, because since then this has gone way further. Basically, the question we were asking ourselves was: <em>Does the world really need so many working people?</em></p>
<p>Back then, both of us thought that if the unemployment was so high is basically because there are no jobs for everyone, plain and simple. Stuff like travel agencies, estate agencies (in Spain, probably the 70% of them are gone), music stores, media stores, cinemas, post offices... all of them seem from a past age. And many more to come.</p>
<p>What we used to say, without giving proper arguments, is that the human race is getting to a point in which we shouldn't work that much. But the established economy model isn't prepared for that yet. I'm sure we'll see some kind of global economy reorganization within ten years. I would like to see it.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"><p>I read this post a couple of days ago and I have to say I concur in most of the points with the writer. Most of the reasons he talks about are the reasons why I blog. Not to make myself advertisement (at all), or because I have nothing better to do. Actually, most of the last posts I've written are quite short because I have plenty of better things to do. For me is as recreational as reading a good book.</p>
<p>But yeah, as <em>Nathan Marz</em> says,  you should blog because it's good for you. You have very little to loose and a lot to win, such as intelligence! Well, not really, but it does help a lot making you think before talking and in a more organised way, in general.</p>
<p>And for me, that was only when I used to write in spanish. Now I'm even practising english! Very little to loose, indeed.</p>

                <div class="entry-content"><p>It's been a <em>museums</em> weekend and for the first time in months, we've had warm weather in London. Since yesterday. I might recover part of my natural tan before August!</p>
<p>And I also haven't touch a keyboard during the weekend, which is cool. It's been some kind of disconnection weekend, something I'm enjoying quite a lot lately. Anyway, I will probably compensate touching too much keyboard during this whole week, as usual.</p>

<p>This picture was taken on the 20something of December 2006, during the first (of two haha) After Hours concert. Six years ago and I still have that jumper. I guess my mom is right when she says I must throw lots of clothes away.</p>
<p>So yesterday I ran San Silvestre, some sort of solidarity run which takes place every 31 of December in a lot of cities and towns of Spain. They are usually short enough so many people are able to run it without trouble. It wasn't that easy for me, I guess, as I've only been running for two months. But it was fun. A lot of people were dressed in costumes, some of them running with their dogs, even pushing their children in baby buggies. The end was having fun and raising money.</p>
<p>And today is the most useless day in the whole year. There's nothing you can do, because everything's closed (at least in Spain). And there is also no energy for moving from home to other place. Completely useless. Hm, I believe I still have that picture's jumper somewhere in the junk room...yeah, I can't see a better thing to do today.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->

                <div class="entry-content"><p>Just moved today into a new flat. This one feels like home, actually. I will (finally) be able to reduce my amount of daily public transport and only take two tubes instead of bus+train+tube every single day. It was exhausting and annoying.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures from my new place.</p>
<p>First one is the living room, from where I'm seated right now. The picture doesn't show the real size of the room, which is quite big. More pictures coming when we get the TV ;)</p>
<p><img alt="living room" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Fl6DKeuD4RE/UNhwdqigZNI/AAAAAAAAB6A/UnipGYaj0OE/s640/D0427FF4-9C59-48E7-A31B-76885E5F5D41.JPG" title="living room" /></p>
<p>This one is the kitchen. Small but cozy.</p>
<p><img alt="kitchen" src="http://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-exwSv2BFggA/UNhwjoYDqTI/AAAAAAAAB6k/6uJv8wpesBs/s512/84B9ADB2-8813-44D4-A459-890934872748.JPG" title="kitchen" /></p>
<p>The last one is my bedroom. I guess it's extremely small compared to the other ones. I should have chosen tails :(</p>

<p>And after a huge dosis of Tuesday pizza, it's bedtime.</p></div><!-- /.entry-content -->
